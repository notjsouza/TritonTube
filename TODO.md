- [ ] Optimize consistent hashing algorithm
- [ ] Add storage usage metrics
- [ ] Implement automatic failover

### Database Enhancements
- [ ] Add database migrations system
- [ ] Implement soft deletes for videos
- [ ] Add video metadata fields (duration, size, format)
- [ ] Create indexes for search performance
- [ ] Add database backup strategy

## üîÑ Phase 4: Advanced Backend Features (Week 7-8)
**Goal:** Add production-ready backend capabilities

### Video Processing
- [ ] Background job queue for video processing
- [ ] Multiple quality/bitrate generation
- [ ] Thumbnail generation at upload
- [ ] Video metadata extraction (duration, resolution)
- [ ] Processing status tracking

### API Enhancements
- [ ] Real-time upload progress via WebSockets
- [ ] Batch operations (bulk delete, upload)
- [ ] Video analytics endpoints
- [ ] Search with filters (date range, duration)
- [ ] Video recommendations API

### Service Reliability
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- [ ] Distributed tracing
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Service discovery integration
- [ ] Configuration management

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 5: AWS Integration & Deployment (Week 9-10)
**Goal:** Deploy backend to AWS with production infrastructure

### Containerization
- [ ] Create optimized Dockerfile for Go backend
- [ ] Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- [ ] Docker health checks
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Secret management integration

### AWS Services Integration
- [ ] S3 integration for video storage
- [ ] CloudWatch logging and metrics
- [ ] ECS task definitions
- [ ] Application Load Balancer configuration
- [ ] RDS for production database (PostgreSQL)

### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions for backend deployment
- [ ] Automated testing in pipeline
- [ ] Database migration automation
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Rollback procedures

## üß™ Phase 6: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Goal:** Ensure backend reliability and maintainability

### Testing Suite
